How to make No Bake oreo cheese cake step by step....


Step 1: Prepare the crust
The first step is to prepare the crust of the cheesecake. Crumble about 250 gm of oreo and mix it with the melted butter. Combine both the ingredients nicely. Press this mixture into a silicon pan, or any other baking pan that you may have. Make sure to take a pan from which removing the cheesecake will be easy. Pop this in the fridge for an hour so that the base sets properly.

Step 2: Prepare the cream filling & let the cake set
Now prepare the filling by mixing together the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla essence in a blender. Blend until smooth. To this mixture, add in the remaining Oreos but do not forget to break the cookies into pieces beforehand. Then fold in the whipped cream gently.

Step 3: Garnish with oreo crumbs
Lastly, pour the filling on the base that has been set before. Pop this in the fridge again for about 4-5 hours. Before serving, garnish with Oreo crumbs.

* Tips:
1.  You can also powder some oreo cookies and sift it over the finished cake for texture.
2.  If you like the combination of berries with chocolate, drizzle some berry-based sweet sauce (for example: cranberry sauce) over the cake.
3.  A springform or circular cake dish works best for oreo cheesecake
